vimrc
=====

Keeping my `.vimrc` in sync across my many computers is the main reason for this repository. A less selfish side effect of this is that you can see how I've customised my [vim](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vim_%28text_editor%29) installations and apply the same changes to your own `.vimrc` file.
